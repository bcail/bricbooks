TODO
----
- catch exceptions and give good error messages in the UI
- load-test the application with many transactions
- add searching (for payee, description)
- switch to Qt GUI? It can handle all Unicode chars, and has good performance - both are issues for Tkinter

PROJECT GOALS
-------------
- easy to install on Windows/Mac/Linux
  * no dependencies besides Python
  * one script (.py file) to deploy
- convenient to use
- accurate finances
- good tests
